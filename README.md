# Eat-da-Burger

An app that lets you add burgers with whatever names you like to a database, then "eat" them, changing their status to "devoured" and moving them from one list into another.

# How to Use This App

* Enter the name of a burger you want to add to the database into the input field in the center of the page, then click Submit.

* It will then be added to a list of Burgers Served on the left-hand side of the screen.

* Each burger in this list will be accompanied by an Eat! button.

* Click on this button to "eat" one of the burgers and move it into the Burgers Devoured list on the right-hand side of the screen.

* Any changes you make to the two lists will persist indefinitely since all the corresponding information is stored in a MySQL database.
